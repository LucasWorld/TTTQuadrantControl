TTTQuadrantControl
=================

## A 4-way button disguised as a table cell, as seen in Tweetie 2

## Demo

After cloning the repository, open the Xcode Project file <tt>/TTTQuadrantControl/Example/Nitwit.xcodeproj</tt>. Build and Run in the iPhone Simulator to see it in action. The specified quadrant actions are stubbed out as an example.

## Usage

Initialize as follows in a UITableViewController or subclass (works best with table views with a <strong>grouped</strong> style):

<code>
  TTTQuadrantControl * quadrantControl = [[[TTTQuadrantControl alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 20, 300, 90)] autorelease];
	quadrantControl.delegate = self;
	[quadrantControl setNumber:[NSNumber numberWithInt:127]
					   caption:@"following"
						action:@selector(didSelectFollowingQuadrant)
				   forLocation:TopLeftLocation];
	
	[quadrantControl setNumber:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1728]
					   caption:@"tweets" 
						action:@selector(didSelectTweetsQuadrant)
				   forLocation:TopRightLocation];
	
	[quadrantControl setNumber:[NSNumber numberWithInt:352] 
					   caption:@"followers" 
						action:@selector(didSelectFollowersQuadrant)
				   forLocation:BottomLeftLocation];
	
	[quadrantControl setNumber:[NSNumber numberWithInt:61] 
					   caption:@"favorites" 
						action:@selector(didSelectFavoritesQuadrant)
				   forLocation:BottomRightLocation];
	[self.tableSectionFooterView addSubview:quadrantControl];
</code>

- <tt>number</tt> - the number displayed at top
- <tt>caption</tt> - the text displayed below the number
- <tt>action</tt> - a selector to be performed by the delegate
- <tt>location</tt> - the specified quadrant to set these values and action for ([TopLeftLocation|TopRightLocation|BottomLeftLocation|BottomRightLocation])

## Requirements

- iPhone OS 3.0 or higher
- QuartzCore framework

## Issues

In its current release, the horizontal and vertical dividing lines in the quadrant control appear to be drawing between pixel boundaries. If you are handy with CoreGraphics and can fix this, I would greatly appreciate it.
